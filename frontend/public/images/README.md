# Chat Illustration Setup

## Steps to Add Your Image:

1. **Save your reference image** (the one with two people sitting and chatting) as:
   - Filename: `chat-illustration.png`
   - Location: `frontend/public/images/chat-illustration.png`

2. **Image Requirements:**
   - Format: PNG (with transparent background if possible)
   - Recommended size: 400-600px wide
   - The image should show two people chatting (like your reference image)

3. **Current Status:**
   - ✅ Component created: `ChatIllustration.tsx`
   - ✅ Directory created: `frontend/public/images/`
   - ⏳ **ACTION NEEDED:** Save your image as `chat-illustration.png` in the `public/images` folder

## Alternative:

If you have the image elsewhere, you can:
- Copy it to: `C:\Users\Navinkumar\Downloads\Edgesoul\frontend\public\images\chat-illustration.png`
- Or provide me the path where you saved it, and I'll help you copy it

The illustration will appear on top of the "Start Chatting" card on all dashboards.
